# Squishy_Experimental-Gameplay-2

Goal - Squishy things are funny and/or cute, maybe squishy could be a feature of my character. So I decide to make a game of squishy character(s).

Inspiration - A youtube video showing how squishy a puppy butt could be.

What is the game -
I have two cats often try to squeeze the other one out on my lap. 
I'd like to make these kinds of delightful moments into my game. 
So I made this game demo for two dogs using their squishy butts to fight for their master's lap.


Gameplay - 

1. Two puppy fight for their masterâ€™s lap (a platform).
2. Both of them want to squeeze out the other one, using their squishy butt.
3. P1: ad for movement, w to jump, qe to swing the butt;
   P2: jl/[4][6] for movement, i/[8] to jump, uo/[7][9] to swing the butt.
4. Once one falls down to the ground, the other one wins the game.
